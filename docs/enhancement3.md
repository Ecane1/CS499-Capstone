# Enhancement 3: Databases ## Summary This enhancement transformed the advising program from a file‑based system into a database‑driven application using MongoDB. The original artifact relied on CSV parsing for every operation, which limited scalability and made data management error‑prone. The enhanced version introduces a persistent backend using a MongoDB collection to store course information, including course IDs, titles, and prerequisite lists. Key improvements include: - Designing a MongoDB schema aligned with the program’s data model - Implementing a repository pattern to separate database logic from application logic - Replacing repeated CSV parsing with efficient database queries - Improving maintainability by centralizing data access in a single module - Demonstrating CRUD‑style operations (insert, read, update, delete) through simulated or real database interactions This enhancement showcases strong competency in database integration, data modeling, and scalable software architecture. ## Links - [Original Artifact](https://github.com/Ecane1/CS499-Capstone/blob/main/CourseInformation_Module_Three_Artifact.zip) - [Enhanced Artifact](https://github.com/Ecane1/CS499-Capstone/blob/main/CourseAdvising_Enhancement_Three.zip) - [Narrative (Word Doc)](https://github.com/Ecane1/CS499-Capstone/blob/main/Narratives/Enhancement3.docx) - [Code Review Video](https://www.youtube.com/yourvideolink)
